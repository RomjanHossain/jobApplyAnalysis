 ### Job Lookup
 
 Description: This a simple job lookup application that allows users to add jobs to a list (sqlite database) and view them in a table. The user can also view the graphs of the jobs by clicking on the 'Graph' button. 

The line graph shows the number of jobs added per month, the pie chart shows the percentage of jobs based on the 
status (applied, interview, offer, rejected).

This ain't a professional application, it's just a simple project to just to do some coding and have fun.

### How to run the application
lol. You already know how to run this. Have fun!
